 * payload. The actual delivery happens via the WS `push-events` channel, which
 * is fed by the bus's `history-recorded` event emitted by the history layer.
 *
 * As a {@link PlatformAdapter} it merely returns ok and lets the
 * MultiplexNotificationSink record the entry in HistoryStore. The dashboard
 * receives every history-recorded entry over the WS channel and renders
 * whatever has `target.platform === 'web-dashboard'` in the notification UI.
